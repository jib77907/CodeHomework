//create a curving line across the canvas
//make the line repeats down the canvas, with equal spaces in between (could use array)
//map the stroke of each line so that the more center the line is in the canvas, the stroke is darker

//this way the curves' amplitude and interval could be manipulated
//also could make the line actually move in waves, rather than just a optical illusion
